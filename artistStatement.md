In my work I dissect the meaning-making practices of power structures.
Exploring subjects as diverse as bald eagles, the NSA, a DVD
screensaver, and Store Quest storage units, my work deviates between a
straightforward unmasking of the veil of autonomy behind these signs to
moments of semiotic play meant to inject elements of hostility,
confusion, rebellion, and the absurd.

I approach my work with an understanding of power structures as semiotic
systems. Like all semiotic systems they are intrinsically social in
their conditions, content, and construct. They rely on social rules and
constraints to define a specific relationship between producer,
receiver, and signifier. This determines what meaning can be produced,
how it can be received, and what signifiers can be used to produce and
maintain a specific version of reality.

In my work I try to upset the relationship between producer, receiver,
and signifier. In *Maneuvers*, for example, image and text compete to
define the referent of a sign and in the process reveals a complex
relationship between man and animal. Similarly, in the series *This is
Not a Pipe*, language and sign are mismatched to undo the autonomy of a
corporate logo.

Almost every piece is modeled closely after a found object or sign. This
means that materials and processes can vary greatly between each one.
However, there is consistent methodology in my production. Each piece is
conceptually driven and it is this concept that determines the forms and
materials used.

The intention of my work is not to produce new meanings that should be
read in place of the originals. This would have the same effect
antithetical critiques always do: in their elaboration of power
relations they make clear what must be rectified for those relations to
remain intact. What I am aiming for is work that makes more transparent
the social systems that facilitate power structures and in the process
opens up space for the contestation of meaning.
