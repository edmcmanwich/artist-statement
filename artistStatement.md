In my work, I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt
to open up new interpretations of the self. Exploring subjects as
diverse as bald eagles, book scanners, DVD screensavers, and Store Quest
storage units, my work deviates between a straightforward unmasking of
the veil of autonomy behind signifiers to moments of semiotic play meant
to inject elements of hostility, confusion, disquiet, and the absurd.

My individual works usually find their locus in some variety of
historical or contemporary text. Situationists-related literature,
psychedelic poetry, and graphic novels have all served as catalysts for
new pieces. Often they start as sources for the collection of a wide
range of materials including objects, writing, image, and video. As
these signs are worked over and treated the originating text becomes
more of a framework for understanding and reimagining the specific
social interests and ideologies that can shape interpretation. The
result of this process is the production of new work where unfamiliar
combinations of semiotic modes can reveal complex relationships between
man and animal or undo the autonomy of a corporate logo.

Attempting to understand how power structures use social rules and
constraints to produce and maintain specific version of reality is a key
component to my practice.

The intention of my work is not to produce new meanings that should be
read in place of the originals. This would have the same effect
antithetical critiques always do: in their elaboration of power
relations they make clear what must be rectified for those relations to
remain intact. What I am aiming for is work that makes more transparent
the social systems that facilitate power structures and in the process
opens up space for the contestation of meaning.
